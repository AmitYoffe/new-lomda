12/13/2023 - i need to make a few question types that can be selected from the lesson factory. Then a teacher can choose a format, build a question,
and compile them into a json or array of the lesson. 

Question Types:
1) Select1ofX - multiple choice questions
2) ConnectDots - connecting 2 terms with lines between the coresponding concepts/ phrases
3) freeText - text for stories, examples, pictures and so on...
4) dropdownText - free text in which you have to complete words from a dropdown choice bank
